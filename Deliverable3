I didn't really encounter any challenges while completing this assignment, I think the requirements were pretty clear as to what was expected from this program. This was the first time I've used unittest for python and I don't think it went too badly. In the past when I've tested my programs I would just enter my own test cases as I programmed. In order to test my program, I made sure to test each one of the different conditionals I had whether it was through the unittest or after I had finished coding. Once I got the expected results from each unittest and test that I ran on my own, I knew I was done.
