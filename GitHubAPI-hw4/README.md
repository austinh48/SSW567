I'm not sure how to set up the config file for multiple files, the tests should pass but I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. The error message is in the picture that's uploaded in this folder.

When I was designing the code, I thought about how to make it so that program users could choose both the user and the repository when testing the program. I also thought about having the output be as simple as possible so the tests would be easy to run. This was my first time working with json files so getting the right information from them was a struggle for me initially.
